   -BOOK STRUCTURE
   -
   -* What to expect
   -  A phrase telling them what to do with the book
   -* Prerequisites:
   -  + Tools neccesary to follow the book (for everything to work), note: the source code can be
   -    found in a repo, though
   -  + Explain how to compile a file (example hello file) and ask them to modify the file
   -    and see what happens. Ask them to open a file with a text editor
   -* How to read:
   -  Explain how the book is supposed to be read (try to answer question with answer
   -  covered, then reveal answer and try understand what is it doing)
   -* Content:
   -  Divide book in multiple sections each with a lot of pieces of code:
   -    1. basic operations, output, if, for, while, and functions
   -    2. recursive functions, input, streams, vector, strings (optional)
   -    3. pointers, arrays, new keyword (pointers and arrays are a very, very long topic)

\listoftodos

\inlinetodo{idea: at some point in the code explain why is the book written in English and
no any other language}

\inlinetodo{idea: have a couple of exercises that could only be done in groups, and make
students do an activity at the start and middle of the class with totally random people to
solve those activities (talleres)}
