# What to expect from this book #

This is NOT a reference book, this is a teaching/practicing book. It is for anybody who is
willing to learn C++ by practicing. This book is also an unusual book. It has taken
inspiration (copied) from a great teaching book for the Scheme programming language: "The
little schemer".

There is a saying in, uh, somewhere in instructional courses, it goes like: Learn like you
work, i.e., you should learn in the same way that you will at some point work. For
example, if you wanna be a chef then cook like a chef, not just learn the recipes! Or if
you are an student of Engineering, learn to solve problems in your area like you will do
in your work, not just apply the equations for the exercise.

Learning is rewarding but it is hard work! If you don't feel that it takes effort to learn,
(you can recall everything) then you are not learning, you are just applying (which is not
bad, it is necessary, but it's NOT learning).
