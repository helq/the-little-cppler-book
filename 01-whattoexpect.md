# What to expect from this book #

\inlinetodo{A phrase telling them what to do with the book}

This is NOT a reference book, this is a teaching book, it is for anybody to acquire
experience writing code in C++.

Learn like you do, don't learn just to accumulate. Learning is rewarding, but teach/apply
what you learn, from day one.
