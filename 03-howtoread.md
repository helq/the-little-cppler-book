# How to read this book #

Yeah, you should learn first how to read this book! :P

The book is divided into three blocks, each block is divided into 4 (or 5) sub-blocks.
Each (sub-)block is dependent in the previous (sub-)blocks, this means that you need to
read sequentially to understand what is any block about.

Each subblock is composed of several (10 to 20) exercises. Each exercise is divided into
two columns, the left column is a question and the answer is in the second column.

Because the answers to the exercises are in the same page as the questions, I recommend you
to cover the answer and try to answer by yourself, when you are sure of the answer (or you
don't know how to answer) look at the right column for the proposed answer.

There are some little tasks in each subblock to perform, tasks are here exercises without
answers, they are possible to solve with the material covered to the point were they are
presented.
