# Block 2: Going further with functions and more space to play with #

<!--
   -2. recursive functions, input, pass by reference, arrays, and string operations
   -  * introduce the magic of recursive functions
   -  * show examples of input from the user
   -  * show how variables passed as value don't change while passed by reference do
   -  * show things to get wrong with input from the user (from wrong type to unexpected
   -    stuff from spaces, tabs and newlines)
   -  * introduce arrays
   -  * show how arrays behave differently from any other value, and how they appear to be
   -    always pass by reference and not by value
   -  * arrays have many gotchas, like asking for a value outside the range of the array
   -  * possible exercises: copy content of an array from one to the other
   -  * (optional) tell them that many people, professionaly, don't like arrays and use
   -    better the standard libraries, which have a lot of functions for common things we
   -    have done already. Like, copying an array, printing it on the screen, ...
